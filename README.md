# Backpropagation-Algorithm
This is a project I did as part of my Computer Science degree. It involves designing a MLP backpropagation algorithm, which taking a dataset of 8 predictors and 1 predictant, splitting the dataset and evaluating its performance in predicting the predicant on the test sub-dataset.
