  <h3 align="center">Error-Correcting MLP Backpropagation Algorithm</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is a project I did as part of my Computer Science degree. It involves designing a MLP backpropagation algorithm, which taking a dataset of 8 predictors and 1 predictant, splitting the dataset and evaluating its performance in predicting the predicant on the test sub-dataset.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this project was implement an artificial neural network, more specifically and multi layered perceptron, trained using the error backpropagation algorithm. The process included data pre-processing (splitting the data into training, validation and test subsets and standardising the data) and creating, training, and implementing the neural network to predict index floods from the given data set.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To set up this project, get a local copy up and running by either cloning this repository to Android Studio,
or downloading the ZIP file of the repository and opening it in Android Studio.


### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following software in order to run this project.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (if cloning the repository)

### Installation
1. Download and install Android Studio. The download link and installation guide can be
found on the following link: [https://developer.android.com/studio/install](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)
2. Press "Clone Repository" in Android Studio. Copy the following repository URL:
   ```sh
   https://github.com/SaoodCS/Ingredilist
   ```
3. Update any gradle and build files if requested by Android Studio
4. Install an AVD emulator to run the app on in Android Studio 

5.<b> To run the app, either:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> a. Press the play button in the top toolbar in Android Studio to run the app on the emulator. <br><br>
            <b>OR:</b>
            <br><br>
            b. Run the AVD emulator -> Once loaded, drag and drop "ingredilist apk.apk" from the projects folder
            to the emulator screen -> find the app on the android emulator and press it.
